# Quest & Achievement

This package provides common quest and achievement features in the game.

---

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set `PlayerEntityAuthorityCheck` to `true` in `WorldConfig`.
If this setting is false, the server function is exposed to all clients, which may lead to security vulnerabilities.

---

## Installation

This package is available for use after import, but some initial setup is required.

**1. Player Components**

The following components need to be added to the `DefaultPlayer`:
- `PlayerDBManager`, `PlayerAccount`, `PlayerAchievement`, `PlayerQuest`

**2. Admin Permissions Check for Tool Usage**

You need to check if the user has admin permissions using the `Util:IsAdmin` function.

**3. UI Path Configuration**

You need to set the spawn paths for the message UI and the tool UI.
- The `ParentUIPath` and `ParentUIToolPath` can be modified in `AchievementSampleLogic`.
- The `ParentUIPath` and `ParentUIToolPath` can be modified in `QuestSampleLogic`.
- By default, they are set to `"/ui/DefaultGroup"`.

**4. DataStorage Name Configuration**

The name you are using might overlap with existing ones.
- Modify the `StorageName` in `GMAchievementToolLogic`.
- Modify the `StorageName` in `GMQuestToolLogic`.

**5. UIHUD**

You can use the UIHUD model to conduct achievement and quest tests.

## Action Event and Condition

Achievements and quests process progress values by receiving `ActionEvent` through `ActionCondition`.

1. Define the desired Action in `ActionEnum` in advance, then create an `ActionEvent` and send it to `UserEntity`.
2. Predefine the desired `ActionCondition` in `ActionConditionEnum`. Inherit from `ActionConditionData`, add a new `ActionConditionData`, and implement it by overriding the necessary functions.
3. The `GetActionEnumList` function must be implemented.
4. Implement the `Check` function and `GetNextUserValue` function to verify whether the `actionEvent` is valid and to return the updated UserValue.
5. Some conditions may require values to be updated when a quest/achievement is reset or when the user logs in. In such cases, implement the `IsUpdateNeeded` and `GetUpdatedValue` functions.

# Achievement

This package provides common achievement features in the game.

## Features

### 1. Achievement Features

The achievement progress increases based on the user's actions, and rewards can be granted upon completion.
Repeatable achievements (daily, weekly, etc.) can be added.

- Achievements can have multiple steps. The value increases up to the last step's value, regardless of the current step.
- A parent achievement can be assigned, and it will be completed once all child achievements are finished.
- Even if achievement data is modified incorrectly, user data is designed to be preserved as much as possible.

### 2. Achievement User Data Management Tool

Allows viewing and modifying user achievement data.

## Usage

Press **F1** to open the UI, where you can view achievement progress and modify user data through the debug interface.
You can configure achievement data in `AchievementDataSet` and `AchievementStepDataSet`.

## Tool Usage

Press **F2** to open the tool UI, which allows you to manage user achievement data.

- The start and end dates are stored and used in **UTC time** in DataStorage.
- You can set the time offset using the **"User Time Offset"** option in the top-left corner.
- User data should be safely modified only when the user is **offline**.
